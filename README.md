The UI.R and Server.R files have been merged into one file i.e. app.R and uploaded. Both the portions are there in app.R as
ui <- function(){...}
server <- function(input, output){...}
It is okay to have one app.R instead of ui.R and server.R
Please go through app.R both sections and then review.
Thank you
